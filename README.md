# class division
Aim of this project is to develop algorithms to do a optimal class division for a set of persons into 2 groups considering different objectives or boundary conditions. 

Such algorithms could be used e.g. to group children into school classes considering their locations (adress) and certain preferences e.g. friendships etc.
